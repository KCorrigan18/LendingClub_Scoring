Repository for files used in NYCDSA Python visualizations project.

Link to blog post explaining background and findings for project: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/lendingclub-grade-optimization/


There are two files associated with this project. LendingClub_Capstone_Project.ipynb is the EDA and investigative file. This is also where the data is cleaned and prepared for machine learning models. The appropriate data file to run this program can be found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club.

After running the first file, two files will be created, incomplete.csv and complete.csv. These are the files used to continue to the model generation file, Capstone_Models.ipynb.
